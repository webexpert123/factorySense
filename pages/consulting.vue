                If you're new to RFID or not sure how to fit the technology into
                your business, we can work together to conduct an on-site RFID
                Site Survey and develop a strategy and detailed action plan to
                integrate realtime location information into your business and
                value streams.

                  Preliminary calls to discuss the business, challenges, and

                </li>
                <li>
                  Review of existing technology stack, ERP system, and how

                  A consultant will come to you and spend a full day on-site
                  working with your materials in your environment
                </li>
                <li>
                  A custom report will be made (typically within 3 days of the
                  visit) outlining the material flow, challenges, and
                  opportunities for RFID along with a detailed action plan and
                  timeline for implementation
                </li>
                <li>
                  The report is delivered, and a review call is scheduled with
                  key points of contact
                </li>
                <li>
                  Any residual action items are followed-up on and actions are

              <h3>What do RFID site surveys look like?</h3>
              <p>
                Every report is custom-tailored for the client's unique
                circumstances, but most include observations of the site,
                operational processes, desired outcomes, challenges, proposed
                changes with detailed actions and timelines, along with key
                performance indicators that would be measurably improved with
                RFID.
              </p>
              <h3>How much do RFID site surveys cost?</h3>
              <p>
                We bill a daily rate for time and travel expenses, so you only
                pay for the time needed to perform the survey. Most site surveys
                can be completed in a full business day, but larger sites may
                require additional days. Contact us for specifics.
